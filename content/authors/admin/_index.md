I am a _Postdocotral Fellow_ at the University of Victoria. My research in the Swayne Lab focuses on investigating the role of the channel-forming protein pannexin 1 (PANX1) in the regulation of nerve cell excitatory connections (known as dendritic spines) using confocal and super-resolution microscopy in fixed and living neurons. My research interests include dendritic spine plasticity, synapse and neuronal network formation, endogenous repair mechanisms, and applying data science principles to cell biology. I also team up with other members of the Swayne Lab that require microscopy, image analysis pipelines, and statistical analysis support.

I am passionate about bridging basic science and medicine. I am a firm believer that strong basic science foundations during medical training are key factors in the formation of newer generations of medical professionals. My goal is to become a physician/scientist carrying on clinical-informed basic science to understand the molecular substrates of neuronal network dysfunction in the injured nervous system.

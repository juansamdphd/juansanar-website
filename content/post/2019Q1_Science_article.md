This year started with a major breakthrough in tissue engineering and disease modeling. For the very first time, “perfect” human vessels were grown in a dish. This daunting task was accomplished by a multidisciplinary team at the Institute of Molecular Biotechnology of the Austrian Academy (IMBA), led by Dr. Josef M. Penninger (Canada Research Chair in Functional Genetics), now at UBC’s Life Science Institute and recruited as part of the Canada 150 Research Chair campaign. The study published in [Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0858-8) represents a gigantic step forward in modelling vascular diseases, allowing researchers to dissect molecular pathways implicating in the development of cardiovascular complications observed in diabetes, Alzheimer’s disease, cancer, stroke, and wound healing.

Most excitatory synapses in the cerebral cortex are located in dendritic spines—miniature specialized structures that play a critical role in neurotransmission within neural networks. Previous studies have shown that the filamentous form of actin (F-actin, a major cytoskeletal component) partially regulates the morphological and functional properties of dendritic spines. Various neurodegenerative diseases are associated with a loss of dendritic spines and morphological and functional changes in dendritic spine properties. For example, in early disease stages, aberrant F-actin organization in dendritic spines has been observed in Alzheimer’s disease mouse models (Rush et al., 2018; Kommaddi et al., 2018), and loss of cortical and hippocampal synapses has been documented in post-mortem brains of Alzheimer´s disease patients (Davies et al., 1987; Scheff et al., 2006, 2007). As the shape of dendritic spines is strongly associated with spine maturity and function, a standardized method to categorize spine shape could enhance the reproducibility of findings underlying synaptic transmission in various neurological disease models and rare samples of human brain tissue. Despite attempts to efficiently characterize spine shape, objective and high-throughput approaches have not kept pace with recent technological advances in microscopy and digital image analysis. Nanguneri and colleagues developed a novel paradigm to characterize objectively dendritic spine shape based on F-actin morphology.

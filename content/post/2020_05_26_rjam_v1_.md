What are R Jam Sessions?
R Jam Sessions are an attempt to learn R by doing and exploring R on some of my favourite subjects. You can find more info on my [GitHub repo](https://github.com/juansamdphd/rjam).

The code is messy, likely ugly, and screams "n00b". So if you have any suggestions don't hesitate to leave comments by submitting issues or reaching out to me though the linked social media channels listed in this website.

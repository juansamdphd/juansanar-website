With the current pandemic pushing us out of our wet-lab benches, it is time to take on Bear Grylls advise and adapt to our new norm. I've always been curious about computer science, and I consider myself fairly tech savvy: I've built my own PC-desktops in the past, I've repaired and upgraded my laptop multiple times, and I'm always on the look of new hardware software trends, mainly as I keep transitioning into using [FOSS (Free and Open Source Software)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software) for most of my applications (upcoming post on this!). In other words, "computer stuff" is on my list of hobbies. This mini guide series has ~~two~~ three main goals:

1. Serve me as a reminder/record of useful and handy resources to learn or freshen up my computational skills.
2. Share with others introductory resources that I hope will help them to apply some of these skills in their daily life and jobs.
3. Have fun learning.

This is **NOT** by any means an invitation to ramp up your work (i.e.,  productivity) while we face this uncharted global challenge. It is an invitation to explore along *yours truly* this hobby. Whether you use these new skills and knowledge for your own research or to set-up a retro-gaming machine, I hope you can enjoy these series, share it with other ones, and even contribute to it!

To kick off this adventure, here I'm dropping two free courses that get to the very basics of programming and algorithmic thinking. Most of us associate `code` or `programming` with hackers, building websites, or robots. But in reality, `code` is everywhere making our lives easier whether we notice it or not. More importantly, modern [biological research](https://www.wired.com/2017/03/biologists-teaching-code-survive/) relies heavily in `coding` and as we keep pushing the boundaries of knowledge, being able to interpret and create our own `code` is becoming an essential skill. 

**Disclaimer:** Most of the posts in these series will come from the perspective of a neurobiolgist. 

### Understand the basics of code (Google Digital Garage)

If you're a completely newbie to programming and tech, then [this free course](https://learndigital.withgoogle.com/digitalgarage/course/basics-code) will give a quick and easy introduction to code. Learn the basic concepts behind programming languages, their application, and why programming is not a thing of **hackers** but a basic skill scientists, engineers, artists, and (honestly) anyone should be familiar with.

### Computational Thinking for Problem Solving (Coursera)

So you've learned why programming languages are so important and useful for our daily life, and I bet (or hope) there's a fire in you instructing you to pick one of the over 250 programming languages and master it.

But before going forward to fully dive into your preferred programming language, why not get a sense of how to think computationally? If you are a scientist, you've been doing something similar for a while now, but with [this course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/computational-thinking-problem-solving#syllabus) you will learn how to adapt such systematic approaches to solving problems with a computer.

Computational thinking is an important skill and something I wish I had learned formally earlier in my life. I hope this course helps you kicking in this new gear in your brain. If you enjoy this course and its content, then make sure to check [this wonderful book](https://algorithmstoliveby.com/) by Brian Christian and Tom Griffiths, "Algorithms to Live By: The Computer Science of Human Decisions".

ProTip: The audiobook version is a great companion for commutes or those long days at the bench or biosafety cabinet!
